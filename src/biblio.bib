abstract = "In a previous paper we have established the theory of transfinite reduction for orthogonal term rewriting systems. In this paper we perform the same task for the lambda calculus. From the viewpoint of infinitary rewriting, the Böhm model of the lambda calculus can be seen as an infinitary term model. In contrast to term rewriting, there are several different possible notions of infinite term, which give rise to different Böhm-like models, which embody different notions of lazy or eager computation."

abstract = {We present a new, syntax-directed framework for Curry-style type systems with subtyping. It supports a rich set of features, and allows for a reasonably simple theory and implementation. The system we consider has sum and product types, universal and existential quantifiers, and inductive and coinductive types. The latter two may carry size invariants that can be used to establish the termination of recursive programs. For example, the termination of quicksort can be derived by showing that partitioning a list does not increase its size. The system deals with complex programs involving mixed induction and coinduction, or even mixed polymorphism and (co-)induction. One of the key ideas is to separate the notion of size from recursion. We do not check the termination of programs directly, but rather show that their (circular) typing proofs are well-founded. Termination is then obtained using a standard (semantic) normalisation proof. To demonstrate the practicality of the system, we provide an implementation accepting all the examples discussed in the article.},
