STLC chapter:

-- add examples of arithmetic terms that are typable in STLC

   1. observe that for all types T, add and mult both have types

      Nat[T] -> Nat[T] -> Nat[T]

      where Nat[T] = (T -> T) -> T -> T

      (See week12 and week13 notes)

   2. observe that exp, defined as \ x . \ y . y x,
      has type

      Nat[T -> T] -> Nat[T] -> Nat[T]

   3. Self-exponentiation, \ x . x x, is not typable.

-- In System F, add more arithmetic terms, including exponentiation
   and self-exponentiation, which is typable.

-- question: when does reduction of simply typed terms require
   renaming?  The example we saw in class where renaming is
   required is for an untyped term, namely

      delta app ->
      app app =
      (\ x . \ y . x y) app ->
      \ y . app y = 
      \ y . (\ x . \ y . x y) y -alpha>
      \ y . (\ x . \ z . x z) y ->
      \ y . \ z . y z

   delta is not simply typable, so this example does not hold
   for STLC.

-- a related question: does hereditary substitution starting with
   a term with all bound variables distinct and different from the
   free variables need renaming?
